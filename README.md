### Description

Its a reletively simple RPG engine without directx or api and its flicker free. Its currently a dead game in progress since me and jimcamel shifted it to directx a year or 2 ago.

So its unfinished and has ip connection beginings, including chat and map sending across the net. Theres no map editor since u can do it in notepad. Feel free to use it for your own game, just e-mail me if u want to.
